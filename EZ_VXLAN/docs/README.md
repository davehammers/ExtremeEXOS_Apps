# EXOS ezspantree.py Application
## ezspantree.py 1.0.0.1
ezspantree.py is an optional EXOS application which will automatically manage the EXOS default spanning tree `s0`.

For Extreme customers migrating from EOS to EXOS, ezspantree.py emulates the EOS behavior of spanning tree by automating the addition/deletion of VLANs/ports for a single MSTP/CIST spanning tree `s0`. (The EOS default behavior)

If ezspantree.py is installed and running, 
- EXOS default spanning tree `s0` is configured to MSTP/CIST mode.
- newly created VLANs are automatically added to EXOS `s0`. 
- If MSTP/CIST is the desired spanning tree behavior for VLANs, no additional user configuration for a VLAN is required.

When first started, ezspantree.py:
- removes the connection of any VLANs associated with EXOS stpd s0
- disables auto-bind of any VLANs associated with EXOS stpd s0 
- reconfigures stpd s0 mode to MSTP/CIST
- scans all VLANs not connected to any stpd
- adds the VLANs to stpd s0
- enables auto-bind for the VLANs for stpd s0

ezspantree.py will continue running in the background and monitor EXOS for newly created VLANs.

As VLANs are created, the VLAN:
- is automatically connected to stpd `s0`
- is enabled for auto-bind 

## Requirements
- ExtremeXOS 21.1.1.4 or any 21.1.1.4 patch

## Files
* [EXOS Switch summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod](summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod)
* [EXOS VM vm-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod](vm-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod)
* [README.md](README.md)

## Download
EXOS offers a variety of download methods. All of the methods below assume the EXOS switch has been configured with an IP address either on the `mgmt` VLAN (for the management port) or `default` VLAN (for the front panel ports).
### Download over tftp
To download summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod to an EXOS switch, place the file in a server tftp directory.

#### Download tftp over management port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download image _serverIP_ summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod

E.g.
`download image 10.10.10.1 summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod`

#### Download tftp over front panel port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download image _serverIP_ summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod vr VR-Default

E.g.
`download image 10.10.10.1 summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod vr VR-Default`

### Download over http
EXOS can download files from a web site using http. 
If your server does not have a web server and Python is installed, Python offers a simple HTTP web server. [Python Simple Web Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)

Example starting a simple python web server on port 8000
```
cd _directory_
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Copy summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod to _directory_ used in the example above.
#### Download http over management port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download url http://_serverIP_/summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod

E.g. `download url http://10.10.10.1/summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod`

#### Download http over front panel port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download url http://_serverIP_/summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod vr VR-Default

E.g. `download url http://10.10.10.1/summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod vr VR-Default`

### Download using EXOS web (Chalet)
- Using your browser, download summitX-21.1.1.4-ezspantree-1.0.0.1.xmod from github to your PC. 
- Then using the EXOS web interface (Chalet), navigate to Apps->File Manager.
- Use: `Upload files from Local Drive:` to upload and install the file to the EXOS switch

## ezspantree.py Usage
In the usage examples, lets assume the command below was used to create VLANs VID 10-15
```
create vlan 10-15
```
EXOS automatically names the VLANs:
- VLAN_0010
- VLAN_0011
- VLAN_0012
- VLAN_0013
- VLAN_0014
- VLAN_0015

### ezspantree.py Getting help
```
# run script ezspantree.py -h
```
```
usage: ezspantree [-h] [-d] {start,stop,show}

positional arguments:
  {start,stop,show}  start      Start automatically adding VLANs to spanning tree s0.
                     stop       Stop automatically adding VLANs to spanning tree s0.
                     show       Show the running status of ezspantree.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug        Enable debug
```
### ezspantree.py Start
ezspantree.py only needs to be started once. It will become part of the EXOS environment and continue to run in the background. If the EXOS switch is rebooted, ezspantree.py will restart automatically.

```
# run script ezspantree.py start
```
```
Spanning Tree Easy Setup
- Configures spanning tree s0 mode to MSTP/CIST
- Scans all VLANs
   if a VLAN is not connected to spanning tree, it is added to s0
   if a VLAN is already connected to spanning tree s0, it is updated
   VLANs connected to spanning tree(s) other than s0 are not affected
- Starts a VLAN monitoring process for any new VLANS
   newly created VLANS are automatically added to spanning tree s0

ezspantree started
Scanning all VLANs
        VLANs not connected to STP will be automatically added to s0

Adding the following VLAN(s) to Spanning Tree s0:
Default
VLAN_0010
VLAN_0011
VLAN_0012

```

To see how ezspantree did, you can use the EXOS command:
```
# show stpd s0
```
```

### ezspantree.py Status
To check the running status of ezspantree.py
```
# run script ezspantree.py show
```
```
ezspantree      Version: 1.0.0.1        process is running
VLANs are automatically added to spanning tree s0
```

### Stopping ezspantree.py
Stopping ezspantree does not change any existing configurations that have already happened. ezspantree.py will no longer automatically add newly created VLANs to STP s0.
```
# run script ezspantree.py stop
```
```
ezspantree stopped
```
To see that ezspanning tree is no longer running:
```
# run script ezspantree.py show
```
```
ezspantree      Version: 1.0.0.1        process is not running
VLANs are not automatically added to spanning tree s0
```

You can see that existing configurations are unaffected by using the command:
```
# show stpd s0
```
```
