EXOS Cloning (clone.py)
=======================
Version 1.1.0.15
----------------
Minimum ExtremeXOS Required
---------------------------
EXOS 21.1.1
    for stanalone and new stack member cloning

EXOS 22.2
    for any stack cloning or slot synchronization

Most of the clone.py application features are compatible with EXOS 21.1 and later releases. Some features such as ``slot`` and cloning an entire stack require EXOS 22.2 and later.

clone.py began shipping as part of EXOS 22.3. To view the version of the cloning application available on an EXOS switch, run the command:

``run script clone.py show``

The latest version of the EXOS cloning application is `here <https://github.com/extremenetworks/EXOS_Apps/tree/master/Clone>`_.

Overview
========
The clone.py application makes a complete software/configuration copy from one EXOS switch (master) to another (client).

Cloning performs the following actions:
 * copies the EXOS inactive operating system partition
 * copies the EXOS active operating system partition
 * (optionally) copies the ``/usr/local/cfg`` directory (see --exos_only option)
 * aligns boot partitions with the master switch
 * copies selected NVRAM elements

   - Boot Partition
   - CLI Banner
   - Failsafe Username
   - Failsafe Password
   - Boot Mode (use for VPEX)
   - SSH key

There are 2 basic ways to clone:

**Network cloning:**
    The master and client switches are connected to a network. The client makes a clone of the master across the network.

    For network cloning, it is not necessary that the master and client switches are located physically together. As long as the IP address of the master is reachable by the client, the client may be cloned using network cloning.

    Example: The master switch is located at the corporate offices in Chicago, USA. A switch is being installed in Paris, France. The new switch in Paris can clone the Chicago master switch over the network.

**USB cloning:**
    The master switch image is recorded on a USB memory module which can be used to clone client switches.

Why use cloning?
----------------
**Complete "One Operation" Copy**
    Beyond the basic EXOS operating system image, there are additional modules (.xmod), which provide increased EXOS functionality, which may be added to your switches. Switches can contain policy files, scripts, additional configurations and applications.

    Or you may create a reference switch with a baseline set of EXOS versions, scripts, policy files etc. just the way you would like all of your EXOS switches to be configured. Use the cloning application to align your new/existing client switches be just like the reference switch.

    To align a new/existing client switch with existing switch contents/configurations would require downloading and installing all of the files/components to each client switch. The cloning application makes a complete software copy from one switch to another in one operation.

    (See also: USB Zero Touch Provisioning in EXOS 22.3 for cloning new switches)

**Backup**
    The cloning application can also be used to create a complete backup of a switch by cloning to a USB memory module. Both EXOS partitions, and the complete configuration directories are recorded on the USB memory module should the switch need to be restored.

**Restriction**
    The clone.py application can clone only clone from switches that use the same type of EXOS image.

    For example, any switch that uses a summitX...xos image can be cloned to any other switch that uses a summitX...xos image.

    A switch that uses an onie...xos image can be cloned to any other switch that uses an onie...xos image.

    It is not possible to clone a switch that uses summitX...xos to an onie...xos switch.

.. centered:: Clone Standalone to Standalone

To clone over a network, both the master and client switch need the cloning application installed. (See `Downloading The Cloning Application`_)

On the master switch
````````````````````
Start the cloning application.  
This only needs to be done once. The master switch may now serve client requests for cloning from any number of client switches.

Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    run script clone.py master

Display:

.. code-block:: bash

    clone.py is started as cloning master
    Use "stop" option to stop cloning master services


On the client switch
````````````````````
For cloning on the client switch, let's assume:

 - the switch has an IP address either via DHCP or manually configured
 - the switch can reach the IP address of the master switch
 - Example if the master switch has the IP address ``10.10.10.1``. Use ``ping`` to test network connectivity from the client to the master switch.

  - ``ping vr VR-Mgmt 10.10.10.1`` for connectivity by the management port
  - ``ping vr VR-Default 10.10.10.1`` for connectivity by the front panel ports

Start the cloning operation on the client switch by entering the following CLI command:

 - ``run script clone.py from 10.10.10.1``

Or to clone only the EXOS software and leave the client configuration unchanged:

 - ``run script clone.py from 10.10.10.1 --exos_only``


Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    run script clone.py from 10.10.10.1

Clone a stack node replacement over a network
---------------------------------------------
To add or replace a switch in a stack, cloning will convert a standalone switch to a stack member.
Stacking attributes, such as slot number, are specified on the command line at the start of the cloning process. Once the new switch has cloned the stack master, it will reboot and become a stack member at the specified slot number.

When cloning a switch to become a stacking member, additional NVRAM attributes are copied from the stack master to the new switch:
 * stacking enabled
 * stack MAC
 * slot number – either provided or derived from the stacking master
 * The ``–M`` option determines if the master-capable option is enabled.

To clone a new stack member over a network, the stacking master and the new stack member need the cloning application installed. (See `Downloading The Cloning Application`_)

When cloning a stack member replacement or adding a new stack member to an existing stack, the simplest network configuration uses the switch management ports.

If the switch management port is normally not used, you can use it for cloning by assigning any IP address on the same subnet, such as a private IP ``192.168.1.1`` for the stack master and ``192.168.1.2`` for the new client switch, and connect the switch management ports directly to each other.

Example command on the master:

.. code-block:: bash

    config mgmt ip 192.168.1.1/24

Example command on the new switch:

.. code-block:: bash

    config mgmt ip 192.168.1.2/24


.. figure::  Standalone2Stack.png
    :figclass: standlone2stack
    :align: center

.. centered:: Clone Add/Replace Stack Switch

**The new/replacement stack member:**
 - The stacking links must be connected to the new stack member
 - The stacking links must be configured properly for that switch type to have stacking connectivity

   - Each switch type has different configuration options for enabling and configuring stacking links. See the EXOS users guide for more information


On the stack master
```````````````````

Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    run script clone.py master

Display:

.. code-block:: bash

    clone.py is started as cloning master
    Use "stop" option to stop cloning master services

On the new stack member 
```````````````````````
First configure the switches stacking-support options so that stacking connectivity will be ready once the switch becomes stacking enabled. **It is important to perform this step before cloning the new switch.** If the switch is cloned as a stacking standby switch, console login and configuration options require contacting a stack master for user authentication. If the stacking links are not configured correctly, then only failsafe login is available

Once the standalone switch stack-support configuration is correct where the switches stack links match the stack, the clone operation will take care of everything else

On the stacking master, use the ``show stacking`` command to see if the new switch stacking links have been configured correctly with stacking-support.

In the examples below, ``10.68.69.94`` is the IP address of the stacking master

Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    show stacking

Display:

Clone an entire stack over a network
------------------------------------
EXOS 22.2 is a minimum requirement for using the cloning application 'Stack Cloning' capability. Each stack member switch must be running EXOS 22.2 or later.

To clone over a network, both the master stack and new stack switch need the cloning application installed. (See `Downloading The Cloning Application`_)

When constucting a new stack, it is sometimes challenging to get the right software on the standalone switches to correctly form a stack. Aligning the boot partition of all the stack member switches is also important for future software upgrades. Using the cloning application, the process of getting the right software on each of the stack members is simplified.

.. figure::  StackToStack.png

.. centered:: Clone Entire Stack

On the master stack
````````````````````
Start the cloning application.
This only needs to be done once. The master switch may now serve client requests for cloning.

Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    run script clone.py master

Display:

.. code-block:: bash

    clone.py is started as cloning master
    Use "stop" option to stop cloning master services

On the new stack
````````````````
Cloning cannot assist with getting the stacking link connectivity correct. Each switch type has unique configurations for
    * ``enable stacking-support``
    * ``config stacking easy-setup``

It doesn't matter if the switches have mismatched software, or the boot partitions do not align. The cloning application will take care of that.

The stack has been formed with some kind of software on all of the switches. The display shows that slots 2,3,4 are incompatible with the stack master. 

In this example, the new stack is cloned from the master stack. The master stack IP address is ``10.68.61.81``.

The stack cloning operation is performed in 2 steps:

#. clone the new stack master switch from the master stack
#. synchronize the rest of the new stack members with the new stack master switch using the EXOS autoexec.xsf capability

Depending on the types of switches, the stack cloning operation may take 4-5 minutes per stack member.
Newer switches take less time.

First step: Start the cloning application on the new stack master switch. It will clone the new stack master switch from the master stack.

.. code-block:: bash

    run script clone.py from 10.68.61.81

Clone standalone switch to standalone switch using USB memory
-------------------------------------------------------------
Customers can create a complete switch image and store it on USB memory. The clone.py application is also stored on the USB memory. The USB memory can then be used to clone other switches, or restore a switch to the state when the switch information was saved to USB.
In EXOS 22.3, a clone image stored on USB memory may be used to auto clone a switch using the USBZTP feature.
(See USB ZTP for more details.)

Clone an entire stack using USB memory
--------------------------------------
Cloning an entire stack from a USB memory module has the same requirements as cloning a stack over the networks. `Clone an entire stack over a network`_.

Instead of cloning the new stack over the network, an existing stack master image is copied to a USB memory module using the procedure `Copying a switch to USB`_.

Synchronize an entire stack to the master
-----------------------------------------
Beginning with EXOS 22.2, the move of functionality from the Linux kernel to user space rendered the stacking command synchronize slot <> non-functional. While the CLI remained the same, the implementation was replaced by the clone.py application.

In this mode the clone.py application uses the stacking link to copy the file system partitions and stacking NVRAM objects from the stack master to the specified slot

.. figure::  SyncSlot.png
    :figclass: syncslot
    :align: center

.. centered:: EXOS sync slot command

When using the CLI command to start the clone.py application, only one slot may be specified.

When running the clone.py application directly, any number of slots including the keyword ‘all’ may be specified. If more than one slot is specified, the master is cloned to each slot one at a time. Early versions would clone the entire stack at once but ran into issues if some slots finished and rebooted, disrupting the stack link to other switches that had not completed the cloning operation.

Application Description
=======================
The clone.py application uses a master/client model.
The master use the Linux tar utility to tar the EXOS partitions directly to a socket connection to the client.
The client uses the Linux tar utility to read the input directly from the socket connect to the master.

There are no intermediate tar files created on either the master or client switch.


.. figure::  MasterClient.png
    :figclass: masterclient
    :align: center

Master
------
When the clone.py is run on a switch as a master, it acts as a server and listens for connection requests from clone.py applications running as clients.

The master will serve up to 8 cloning clients at a time. The master listens on VR-Mgmt and VR-Default for external client requests and VR-Control for stacking cloning requests.

Client
------
When the clone.py application runs as a client, it attempts to connect with the clone master on VR-Mgmt and VR-Default for standalone operations, and VR-Control for synchronize slot <>.

USB
---
When the clone.py application is used to create a clone image on the USB memory, it creates a file with a .cln suffix

When the clone.py application is used to reimage a switch, the file name is provided in the command. Typically it will be the <file>.cln created by the creation process

Downloading The Cloning Application
===================================
If the EXOS switch can connect with the github directly, use the following CLI command to upgrade clone.py to the latest version:

Using the management port

``download url https://github.com/extremenetworks/EXOS_Apps/raw/master/Clone/summitX-clone-1.1.0.15.xmod``

Or

``download url https://github.com/extremenetworks/EXOS_Apps/raw/master/Clone/onie-clone-1.1.0.15.xmod``

Using a front panel port

``download url https://github.com/extremenetworks/EXOS_Apps/raw/master/Clone/summitX-clone-1.1.0.15.xmod vr VR-Default``

Or

``download url https://github.com/extremenetworks/EXOS_Apps/raw/master/Clone/onie-clone-1.1.0.15.xmod vr VR-Default``

``<ipaddress>``
    The ipaddress of the switch running clone.py as a master. E.g. run script clone.py from 10.10.10.1 will attempt to contact a clone.py master running on 10.10.10.1 on both the VR-Mgmt and VR-Default VRs

``-h``
    show this help message and exit

``-f, --force``
    By default, clone.py prompts for a confirmation if it should proceed with the cloning operation. If clone.py is used by another script or CLI command, the prompt is not desired. The –force option bypasses the confirmation prompt

``-s, --stacking_slot <slot>``
    This option is used to tell clone.py to clone the switch as a member of a stack. The <ipaddress> is the stack masters IP address and clone.py is running as a clone master on the stack master. The slot can be provided so that the switch will have that stacking slot number when cloning is complete, or slot number can be 0. If slot is 0, clone.py will ask the stacking master which slot number is the first available

``-M, --stacking_master``
    When –s is specified indicating that clone.py is cloning the switch to be a stack member, the default behavior is to configure the switch as a standby node. Using this option, the switch is configured to be ``stacking master-capable on``

``-e, --exos_only``
    If this option is provided, the ``/usr/local/cfg`` partition is not copied from the clone master. This is useful to synchronize /exos, /boot, /alt/exos, /alt/boot and which is the boot partition. It is faster that performing 2 upgrades and aligning which is the booted image using conventional CLI commands. The contents of the ``/usr/local/cfg`` partition are unaffected

.. figure::  StandaloneToStack.png
    :figclass: standlone2stack
    :align: center

This example shows a standalone switch being cloned from a stack master. The –s or --stacking_slot <slot> tells clone.py the type of clone to be done

When cloning to become a stacking member, additional NVRAM attributes are copied
* stacking enabled
* stack MAC
* slot number – either provided or derived from the stacking master
* The –M option determines if the master-capable option is enabled.

`On the stack master`

Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    Stack.1 > run script clone.py master

Display:

.. code-block:: bash

    clone.py is started as cloning master
    Use "stop" option to stop cloning master services

    Slot-2 Stack.2 #

`On the standalone switch`
First configure the switches stacking-support options so that stacking connectivity will be ready once the switch becomes stacking enabled. **It is important to perform this step before cloning the standalone switch.** If the switch is cloned as a stacking standby switch, console login and configuration options require contacting a stack master for user authentication. If the stacking links are not configured correctly, then only failsafe login is available

Once the standalone switch stack-support configuration is correct so the switches stack links match the stack, the clone operation will take care of everything else

Use the ``show stacking`` command to see if the stacking links have been configured correctly with stacking-support.

Command:

.. code-block:: bash

    > show stacking

Display:

``-f, --force``
    By default, clone.py prompts for a confirmation if it should proceed with the cloning operation. If clone.py is used by another script or CLI command, the prompt is not desired. The –force optoin bypasses the confirmation promt

``-e, --exos_only``
    If this option is provided, the ``/usr/local/cfg`` partition is not copied from the clone master. This is useful to synchronize /exos, /boot, /alt/exos, /alt/boot and the boot partition selection. It is faster that performing 2 upgrades and aligning which is the booted image using conventional CLI commands. The contents of the ``/usr/local/cfg`` partition are unaffected.

``-i USB_INPUT, --usb_input USB_INPUT``
    When cloning a switch from a USB memory file created by ``usb –o``, this option specifies the file name of the ``clone.py –o <filename>`` used as input to the clone.py application. 

``-o``
    clone.py creates a clone image file on USB memory ``/usr/local/ext``

``-v USB_FILE, --usb_file USB_FILE``
    Show the EXOS versions of a file created by usb –o. The EXOS versions for /exos and /alt/exos are useful pieces of information to know when cloning a new switch. This command extracts the EXOS versions from the .cln file and displays the EXOS versions.


``usb -o``
``````````
This option creates a clone image file on USB memory, Using the –e (--exos_only) option, the ``/usr/local/cfg`` partition is not included in the clone file.

This option requires a USB memory is inserted into the switches USB port. USB memory is mounted on directory ``/usr/local/ext``.
